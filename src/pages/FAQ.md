  - question: For which types of user research studies can I recruit participants
      on Tandemz?
    answer: 'Tandemz allows you to recruit participants for all your research studies
      : surveys, in person or online interviews / user tests, unmoderated usability
      test, tree testing/card sorting, 1st click/5seconds test...'
  - question: How participants are sourced?
    answer: Our participants come both from our worldwide community based on social
      media. We sourced the participants according to your criteria directly on social
      networks such as Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn. If our commnity is not sufficient
      for your needs, our algorithm chooses the best social media for your target
      and publishes ad content specifically for your study.
  - question: In which country can I recruit my participants?
    answer: 'Many countries already are represented in our community: USA, Canada,
      Brazil, Argentina, Chile, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, UK, Belgium, Netherlands,
      Saudi Arabia, Korea, Japan, Hong Kongâ€¦ Participants are sourced in English language.
      If you want us to source participants in another language, translation fees
      will be added.'
  - question: 'How is the price calculated? '
    answer: |-
      Our pricing includes participants incentive and our service fee. Our algorithm adjusts each part according to the type of study, cost of living in selected countries (to keep our incentives attractive) and complexity of recruitment. Each criteria can have an impact on the incentive and/or on the fees.

  - question: Why does each criteria have a different impact on the final price?
    answer: Each criteria does not imply the same complexity as another. Our algorithm
      takes into account the difficulty of each criteria to offer your the best price
      according to your needs!
  - question: How is profile selection made?
    answer: Once you launch the recruitment, our algorithm will automatically contact
      the profile that best suits your target audience. On Tandemz platform, you can
      have a view on the answers of each participant to your screener and check their
      profile. You then decide which one you actually want feedback from to get the
      best insights by accepting or rejecting each participant.
  - question: Can I make my study directly on Tandemz platform (such as a survey,
      an unmoderated usability test or an online session)?
    answer: Not yet! But you can add a link to your current tools for the participants.
  - question: How long does it take to start the recruitment?
    answer: As soon as you launch recruitment, our algorithm starts contacting the
      best profiles for your study. Your first participants are recruited in a few
      hours only!
  - question: I need to recruit B2B participants or a difficult target. Is it possible
      on Tandemz?
    answer: It is possible to target B2B participants or a difficult target on Tandemz.
      But both the incentive and the fees will be high, as the recruitment will be
      complex.
  - question: I need more criteria than the ones available on the pricing page.
    answer: You can add a screener before launching the recruitment in which you can
      ask any question you want to know better about your participants and to select
      the ones you really want to connect with. If this solution does not fit you,
      contact us so that we can help you better.
  - question: I need help to choose the right user research method or to lead my study.
    answer: We can offer you additional services to help you during your study. Do
      not hesitate to contact us by chat or by email at contact@tandemz.io to let
      us know your needs.
