          Tandemz’s service is simple and reliable. What I liked the most was being
          able to quickly reach international targets, in the US or in the UK for example.

          The participants recruited by Tandemz were amazing! Reliable, involved,
          they all played along. My user tests took place without the slightest issue
          and the Tandemz team was very reactive!
