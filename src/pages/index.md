  - question: How are participants and testers recruited?
    answer: We mainly recruit participants through social media ads - this allows
      us to be very precise in our targeting and to recruit worldwide!
  - question: How long does it take to recruit participants?
    answer: "For general targets, the first couple of qualified participants generally
      appear within 24h after your project launch. The session will then fill itself
      within 3 to 5 working days.  \nFor professional targets, timing is trickier,
      therefore we usually set up a call with you in order to be able to estimate
      the time it would take to recruit."
  - question: In what countries exactly do you recruit participants?
    answer: "Our recruitment method through social network ads allows us to people
      in any country! For now our clients mainly recruit in the US, France, the UK,
      Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil and HongKong.  \nThe only country that is for
      now unavailable is China, as most of the social networks we use are banned there."
  - question: Do you recruit professionals for studies on B2B products?
    answer: Yes we do! However, we will need to discuss your target directly before
      we can start recruiting in order to study the project's complexity and timing
      needs. Just choose the "Professionals" option in our recruit page to send us
      your requirements, and we will be in touch!

    content: The participants recruited by Tandemz were amazing! Reliable, involved,

      and the Tandemz team was very reactive!
