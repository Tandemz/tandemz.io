One of the most common question we get from clients and prospects is the following one: "Can you recruit {{insert audience description}} ?"

Want to have a look on what Tandemz is capable of on your own, instead of asking us? It now possible! 

We've compiled a **database of recruitments** made through our platform. Some of these studies were successes, and some were not : the goal is to **help you get an idea of what we can and can't do**, in what time, and at what cost.

This is an interactive document, constantly evolving according to our latest fulfilled recruitments, that can be filtered and sorted to help you find a recruitment that could be close to what you need. For each selected study, you'll be able to see :

* The audience's **country** of residence (some studies recruit in multiple countries). Some studies targeted specific cities. Those are marked with the mention "üìç city or neighbourhood" in addition to the country tag
* The **type of study** :
  * B2C or B2B
  * Remote or In person
  * Additional mention if was a focus group (most studies are one to one discussions)
* The **audience** and **themes** for this study. These are premade categories to help you narrow down your search. _Note that on the platform, audiences are much more precise (you can target several demographic and professional criteria, we just couldn't make everything fit in here_üòÖ*)*.
* A brief description of the audience, to give additional detail on the participants recruited
* How many participants were requested, and how many were actually recruited
* How long it took to recruit these participants.
* How much it cost per participant

Not all of our studies or details are displayed for confidentiality reasons but there should be enough information to get a grasp of the target audience for each study.
