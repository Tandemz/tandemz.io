    answer: Participants are recruited from our worldwide community, and when the
      community is insufficient to meet your study needs, we source them directly

      right users.

      Brazil, Argentina, Chile, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, UK, Belgium, Netherlands,
      Saudi Arabia, Korea, Japan, Hong Kongâ€¦ Participants can be sourced either in
      English or in native language. If you want us to source participants in native
      language, translation fees may be added (depending on the country - ask us if
      you need more information).'

  - question: How does each criteria impact the final price?
    answer: Our algorithm takes into account the difficulty of each criteria to offer
      you the best price according to your needs! This difficulty is evaluated according
      to the size of your potential target audience, and as such, price adjustments
      might differ from one criteria to the other.
  - question: How does the profile selection work?
    answer: Once you launch the recruitment, our algorithm will automatically contact
      the profile that best suits your target audience. On the Tandemz platform, you
      can view each participant's answers to your screener and check their profile.
      You can pick and choose which participants are best suited to your study, and
      reject the other profiles!
  - question: Can I make my study directly on Tandemz (such as a survey form, an unmoderated
      usability test or an online session)?
    answer: Not yet! But you can add a link to your current tools so that participants
      can be redirected to the study.
  - question: How long does it take to start the recruitment?
    answer: As soon as you launch recruitment, our algorithm starts contacting the
      best profiles for your study. Your get your first participants in just a few
      hours!
  - question: I need to recruit B2B participants or a difficult target. Is it possible
      on Tandemz?
    answer: It is possible to target B2B participants or a difficult target on Tandemz.
      Both the incentive and the fees will be higher, as the recruitment will be more
      complex.
  - question: I need more criteria than the ones available on the pricing page.
    answer: You can add a screener before launching the recruitment. Use the screener
      to ask any question you need in order to gain better knowledge of your participants'
      profiles. You will then be able to select the ones you really want to connect
      with. If this solution does not fit you, contact us, we'd be happy to help and
      find an alternative way of targeting your dream participants!
  - question: I need help to choose the right user research method or to lead my study.
