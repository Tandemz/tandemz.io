## Responsibility

TANDEMZ is subject to an obligation of means in providing the Services to the Customer. The Customer expressly acknowledges having received from TANDEMZ all the necessary information, enabling them to assess the suitability of the Services to their needs. 

The Customer is informed that the participants in the studies are selected by TANDEMZ on the basis of the information they declare to it and that TANDEMZ does not verify the veracity of this information. 

TANDEMZ's liability towards the Customer may only be sought in the event of direct damage suffered by the Customer that is caused by a proven contractual breach by TANDEMZ committed in or during the performance of its obligations. 

TANDEMZ shall not be liable for indirect damages of any kind suffered by the Customer, including, but not limited to, loss of profit, loss of business, loss of clientele, commercial disturbance of any kind, damage to image, in connection with or arising from the provision of the Services.

* with respect to the relationship and discussions between the Customer and the study participants; 
* for damages caused to the study participant(s) by the Customer; 
* for damages caused to Customer by the participant.

## Force Majeure

Neither of the two parties will be held responsible towards the other for the non-execution or the delays in the execution of an obligation of the GTS which would be due to the fact of the other party following the occurrence of a case of force majeure within the meaning of the Civil Code and the jurisprudence. 

In the event of a force majeure event, the affected Party shall immediately inform the other Party and the Parties shall take all reasonable measures to limit the consequences of such an event. In the event of the occurrence of an event of force majeure resulting in the temporary impossibility for one of the Parties to perform its obligations, the non-performance of its obligations by the affected Party shall be tolerated for the duration of the event of force majeure and at most for the continuous period of thirty (30) calendar days. Beyond that, the Parties may terminate the Contract by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt without any further formality.
