As a UX Designer, France used to do a lot of user tests or interviews for different clients in her previous job. But as different as the projects were, it was always painful and difficult to find the right testers. She often finished by interviewing her colleagues at coffee break to get a user test done. How can recruiting participants for user research be so difficult nowadays, when everyone is connected to anyone at anytime using Internet? And according to UX communities, the problem is real for a lot of UX Designers or product teams.

What if you could get insights from real users in just a few clicks? What if you could get in touch with your target easily, whenever and wherever you need?
